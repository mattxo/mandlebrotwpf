# Mandlebrot WPF
Generating the Mandlebrot, Julia sets and other fractals in WPF with GLSL shaders and smooth colors. 

You can zoom, pan, change the iteration depth, or input your own equation/code.

You can also use variables like mousePosition and frameIndex to generate fractals that move in real-time. Very pretty :)
